project Diabetes classification:
this project is to classify patients as either diabetic or non-diabetic using a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier. The project aimed to help detect diabetes early by analyzing various health metrics. Since diabetes is a significant health issue, the model focused on identifying patterns to classify patients into two distinct groups. i developed this project during THE T IN STEM workshop, part of the Intermediate Track (Machine Learning) by the CodewithSerah community, and achieved an accuracy rate of 76.6%.
